# DetectionSpermAbnormalities
The aim of this project was detection and segmentation of typical parts of the sperm cell (head, acrosome, tail) and classification of sperm head defects on the microscopic images, using neural networks (MaskR-CNN) and support-vector machine classifier. This was a group project funded by AITech.
